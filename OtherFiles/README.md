      <h2>Hands on Reinforcement Learning [ Project ID: 153 ]</h2>

      <p>Description: Hands on Reinforcement Learning
        Reading material-Sutton & Barto,Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning
        We will be following Grookings as a reference for the theory, and read chapters from it while implementing the strategies described in it in Python.
        Some resources we may use are the slides on RL by David Silver (https://www.deepmind.com/learning-resources/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-with-david-silver) and the slides from the course CS 747: Foundations of Intelligent and Learning Agents (https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/old/cs747-a2022/index.html)
        I have done both WIDS and soc myself under same topic whose repo is below-

      <p>Timeline: Week 1-Implementations of common Machine Learning Algorithms
        Using the standard implementations of some famous algorithms using Scikit-Learn.
        Week 2-MAB,MDPs,Implement a game of Snake
        Learning objectives for this week are:
        1. N-armed bandits: Perhaps the simplest RL challenge. You are provided with n arms, and you can pull one of them at a time. Each arm gives a reward from a probability distribution, independent of which arms you pulled beforehand (However it may depend on the time step you pull). Your task is to maximize the sum of these rewards, that is essentially find the arm which gives the maximum expected reward. We will be studying few algorithms to solve this problem.
        2. Formalism of Reinforcement Learning in terms of Markov Decision Process: Way to generalise and represent a given problem as a Reinforcement Learning problem.
        3. Dynamic Programming: The most basic set of algorithms to deal with prediction and control problems, that is, finding an optimal policy given the complete Markov Decision Process
        Week 3-Monte Carlo Methods,Temporal Difference Learning
        Part I is on implementing the Monte Carlo ES algorithm for a given MDP. I've provided the MDP as a Linux executable. If it doesn't run on your device please let me know, and I will share another executable.
        Part II is on solving the game of Tic Tac Toe. Tic Tac Toe can be solved exactly via the minimax algorithm, and in Part I you will have to implement this algorithm. However, you will see that this algorithm is extremely computationally expensive. Therefore, we will use an on policy RL algorithm (we will use an algorithm based on Îµ-soft policies).
        Week 4-DDQN
        Reading chapters grookings and implementing
        Week 5 and 6- Implementing a paper to create a Chess Engine based on Deep RL
        Implement the paper.

  <p>
    I am very much interested in learning about Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning (as AI-ML is a field with very high demand ðŸ™‚).
    I believe working on your project would be a fantastic way for me to advance in this area.
    I am excited to learn about the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning and machine learning and their real-world applications.
    I also have a basic knowledge of Python. I have a strong commitment to learning and meeting deadlines.
    I am confident that my participation will enhance my Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning expertise.
