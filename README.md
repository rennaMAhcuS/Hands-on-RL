## [Week 1](Week1)

This week covers the basic topics of **`python`** required for **Machine Learning** and **Reinforcement Learning**.
The basics of **Reinforcement Learning** are also covered in the books **Grokking RL** and **Sutton and Barto**.

## [Week 2](Week2)

This week covers the basics of **Reinforcement Learning**, mainly covered from **Grokking RL**.
It also has an assignment to cover the basics of writing a game in **`python`** using the **`pygame`** module.

## [Week 3](Week3)

This week covers the algorithms to deal with **Prediction and Control problems**.

## [Week 4](Week4)

This week covers the implementation of the Multi-armed bandit problem implemented in **`python`**.

## [Week 5](Week5)

This week covers **Temporal Difference Learning**, **Q Learning** and **Eligibility Traces** along with a simple game
and using **Q-learning** to **"solve"** the environment.

## [Week 6](Week6)

We have reached the ending!
We will be implementing [**this paper**](Week6/thesis.pdf) to create a Chess Engine based on Deep RL.

> [!TIP]
> 
> There were some dead weeks also in between in my SoC.
> Considering those also would make this an ~8-Week course.
> I have removed all the inactive weeks from this repository to streamline it for convenient learning.
