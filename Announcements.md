# Hands on RL: SOC
## [Week 1](<./Week 1>) 
So for the first week we'll start with a bit of light work. Your task will be to read the first two chapters from
grookings and explore more about the new terms that you come across.

Also in this week, we will learn about Python, in particular Python Libraries such as NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch,
MatPlotLib and Scikit-Learn.

We will implement some of the common ML algorithms from scratch, I will provide some reading material for the same and
an assignment by eod or by tomorrow. Till then, you can get some basic ideas about Machine Learning through any online
source or YouTube video.
