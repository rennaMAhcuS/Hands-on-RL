# Week 6

As we are near the end of SoC lets gear up.
I hope everyone has read up on TD Learning and Q Learning.
The next topic is on Eligibility Traces, in Chapter 6 of S&B. Please try to read it within a few days.
The assignment for TD Learning and Q Learning will be merged with the assignment on Eligibility Traces and will be
released soon.
(It will require these parts, hence reading this is necessary)

Your task will be implementing the above paper to create a Chess Engine based on Deep RL.
You are encouraged to do this in the team that were formed in the beginning.
