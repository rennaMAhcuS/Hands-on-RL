# Week 3

It's time to start proper Reinforcement Learning!

We will be looking at two classes of algorithms to deal with prediction and control problems,
when we don't know the model of the environment:

1. Monte Carlo Methods
2. Temporal Difference Learning


## Reading Material

- The primary reading material for this week will be Chapters 5 and 6 of **Grokking RL**.
- Also, if you are interested in a more theoretical approach, you may also refer to chapters 5 and 6 from **Sutton and
  Barto** and additionally chapter 7 for Eligibility Traces, which acts as a bridge between these two classes of
  algorithms.
  The topics may seem more difficult than what you have been reading upon, but the basic ideas remain the same, and by
  the end, you will definitely get a sense of how these algorithms are constructed.

> [!TIP]
> 
> You can also read the material on **Thompson Sampling** as an extra read.
