## Week 1

So for the first week, we'll start with some light work.
The task is to read the first two chapters from **Grokking** and explore the new terms you come across.

Also, this week, we will learn about **`python`**, in particular Python Libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`,
`tensorflow`, `pytorch`, `matplotlib` and Scikit-Learn(`sklean`).

We will implement some of the common ML algorithms from scratch.

<!-- Some basic ideas on Machine Learning (if you are interested) can be achieved from [**here**](). -->

<!--
I will provide some reading material for the same and an assignment by EOD or tomorrow.
Till then, you can get some basic ideas about Machine Learning through any online source
or YouTube video.
Also, I feel the best way to enhance collaboration in this project is to make teams among the mentees.
Please find a group of co-mentees and team up with (no strict limit on team size).
Let me know the people you are teaming up with.
Also note that, in the end, we wish all the mentees to work together on this project.
Hence, team membership is not fixed for the project's duration, and there is no cap on team size.
Collaboration and Discussions across teams are also encouraged.

### Reading Material

- The first two chapters from **Grokking RL**.
- You can also read the first chapter of **Sutton and Barto** if you finish the first two chapters of **Grokking RL**.

<!--
For this week, DM the solution files to me. We will make a proper repository the next week.
Note that using any generative AI is not encouraged.
Happy Learning!
